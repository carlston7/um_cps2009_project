## Commit Style
Commits should be formatted with the task ID followed by a description of the task. 

**Example:**
- `ID-12 - Updated UI`
- `ID-47 & ID-18 - Changed user registration (Deleted views dir)`

All work must be pushed to the development branch or a separate feature branch. Code should only be transferred to the main branch via pull requests on GitHub.
